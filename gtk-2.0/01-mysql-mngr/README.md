MySQL MANAGER
--------------
This is a MySQL client manager writen in C and uses the GTK+ 2.0.
This project is based on my FP final project, which it was writen in
Visual Basic.NET and only for Window$.

But this will be different. With the power of C and GTK+, I will write
the code from start and will be a multi-platform program.

Now, the version list.

0.0.2:
· Improved the main window class.
· Creation of status-bar with his status label.
· Creation of 'events.h' and 'events.c' files. Store all events used in the
  project.



0.0.1:
· Creation of main window class.
· Creation of menu-bar.
