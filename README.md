This is a branch with differents C projects. You need the GCC compiler
(Window$ users can download the MinGW software for GNU tools support. 
 You need download the libraries too).


For UNIX / Linux users, things is always easy. Install the dev-libraries
for GTK+ 2.0, GTK+ 3.0 and MySQL.

Happy coding! :)
